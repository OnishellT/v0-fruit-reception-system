   - On-screen keypad implementation
   - Layout toggle effectiveness
   - Form usability for truck drivers/workers
   - Data entry workflows

2. Then, use the workflow-analyst agent to review:
   - Reception creation flow
   - Dynamic detail entry
   - Reception editing capabilities
   - Search functionality
   - Integration between tables
   - Real-world farm operation compatibility

Coordinate between these agents to ensure mobile updates are optimized for agricultural workers.
