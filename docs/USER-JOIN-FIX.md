# User Join Fix - Receptions Table

## Error
```
Runtime TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'username')
at components/receptions-table.tsx:88:53
```

## Root Cause
The `receptions-table.tsx` component was trying to access `reception.created_by_user.username`, but the Supabase queries in `getReceptions()` and `getReceptionDetails()` were not including the join to the `users` table.

## Solution

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/actions/reception.ts`**
   - Updated `getReceptions()` query to include:
     ```sql
     created_by_user:users(id, username)
     ```
   - Updated `getReceptionDetails()` query to include:
     ```sql
     created_by_user:users(id, username)
     ```

2. **`components/receptions-table.tsx`**
   - Added optional chaining for safe access:
     ```typescript
     {reception.created_by_user?.username || "N/A"}
     ```

3. **`app/dashboard/reception/[id]/page.tsx`**
   - Added optional chaining for safe access:
     ```typescript
     {reception.created_by_user?.username || "N/A"}
     ```

## What Was Changed

### Before:
```typescript
// Query missing users join
.select(`
  *,
  provider:providers(id, code, name),
  driver:drivers(id, name),
  fruit_type:fruit_types(id, type, subtype)
`)
```

### After:
```typescript
// Query includes users join
.select(`
  *,
  provider:providers(id, code, name),
  driver:drivers(id, name),
  fruit_type:fruit_types(id, type, subtype),
  created_by_user:users(id, username)
`)
```

## Why This Works

1. **Missing Join**: The original queries didn't fetch user data from the `users` table
2. **Undefined Property**: When `created_by_user` was undefined, accessing `.username` threw an error
3. **Added Join**: Now Supabase fetches the related user data using the foreign key
4. **Safe Access**: Optional chaining (`?.`) prevents errors if data is still missing

## Testing

After the fix:
- ✅ Receptions list loads without errors
- ✅ User column shows username
- ✅ Detail pages load without errors
- ✅ "N/A" shown if user data is missing (graceful degradation)

*Fix applied and tested - error resolved!*
